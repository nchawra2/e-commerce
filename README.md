E-Commerce Application 
----------------------------

A minimal e-commerce application build using react library and used redux for state management. It's a
full stack application that has capabilities that u see in a real world app. I have used bootstrap for the UI and EXPRESS - MONGODB for the backend. It have all those functionalities that u see in a full stack app.

Features :
- user authentication and authorization
- add to cart
- place order and update address
- product upload functionality
- REST API 
- REDUX state management
- JWT token for authentication
